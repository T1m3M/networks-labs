## Description
This was Assignment-1 part of the Networks-1 Course in FCAI-CU
The goal was to implement TCP, TCP with threads and UDP using Java socket programming as seperate 3 tasks

## TCP
The client enters a number, the server replies whether this number is prime or not and whether it's even or odd

## TCP with Threads
The client enters a name, the server replies with his/her grade

## UDP
The client supplies the PC host name on the network, the server replies with it's IP address

*Note: I used eclipse IDE for java developers in this code*
